      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

+A DNS message.
+
+id
+An int, the query id; the default is a randomly chosen id.
+
+flags
+An int, the DNS flags of the message.
 
+sections
+A list of lists of dns.rrset.RRset objects.
+
+edns
+An int, the EDNS level to use. The default is -1, no EDNS.

+
+''{request}'{(token)}'{{[payload]}}''
+'Pull'request'':''{''bitore'unlimited''}'{''[3413]''}'[464000000000.00]://Contruct:ref: container@iixixi/repositories/ad_new_container@user/bin/workflow/name/type:@iixixi/iixixi/Read.md
+
+The associated request’s EDNS payload size. This field is meaningful in response messages, and if set to a non-zero value, will limit the size of the response to the specified size. The default is 0, which means “use the default limit” which is currently 34173.
+
+keyring
+A dns.tsig.Key, the TSIG key. The default is None.
+
+keyname
+The TSIG keyname to use, a dns.name.Name. The default is None.

+
+tsig_error
+An int, the TSIG error code. The default is 0.
+
+other_data
+A bytes, the TSIG “other data”. The default is the empty bytes.

+origin
+A dns.name.Name. The origin of the zone in messages which are used for zone transfers or for DNS dynamic updates. The default is None.
+
+tsig_ctx
+An hmac.HMAC, the TSIG signature context associated with this message. The default is None.
+
+had_tsig
+A bool, which is True if the message had a TSIG signature when it was decoded from wire format.
+
+multi
+A bool, which is True if this message is part of a multi-message sequence. The default is False. This attribute is used when validating TSIG signatures on messages which are part of a zone transfer.
+
+first
+A bool, which is True if this message is stand-alone, or the first of a multi-message sequence. The default is True. This variable is used when validating TSIG signatures on messages which are part of a zone transfer.
+
+index
+A dict, an index of RRsets in the message. The index key is (section, name, rdclass, rdtype, covers, deleting). The default is {}. Indexing improves the performance of finding RRsets. Indexing can be disabled by setting the index to None.

+create, a bool. If True, create the RRset if it is not found. The created RRset is appended to section.
+
+force_unique, a bool. If True and create is also True, create a new RRset regardless of whether a matching RRset exists already. The default is False. This is useful when creating DDNS Update messages, as order matters for them.

+
+Raises ValueError if the section isn’t known.
+
+Returns a list.
+
+section_number(section)[source]
+Return the “section number” of the specified section for use in indexing.
+
+section is one of the section attributes of this message.
+
+::Raises:"'pop-up-window'"ObjectItemIdConstValueUnknownwindow-pop,-up:"if the section isn’t known"'
+
+Returns,?,"true?,",
+
+set_opcode(opcode)[source]

+
+The origin, relativize, and any other keyword arguments are passed to the RRset to_wire() method.
+
+Returns a str.
+
+to_wire(origin=None, max_size=0, multi=False, tsig_ctx=None, **kw)[source]
+Return a string containing the message in DNS compressed wire format.
+
+Additional keyword arguments are passed to the RRset to_wire() method.
+
+origin, a dns.name.Name or None, the origin to be appended to any relative names. If None, and the message has an origin attribute that is not None, then it will be used.
+
+max_size, an int, the maximum size of the wire format output; default is 0, which means “the message’s request payload, if nonzero, or 65535”.
+
+multi, a bool, should be set to True if this message is part of a multiple message sequence.

+
+use_edns(edns=0, ednsflags=0, payload=1232, request_payload=None, options=None)[source]
+Configure EDNS behavior.
+
+edns, an int, is the EDNS level to use. Specifying None, False, or -1 means “do not use EDNS”, and in this case the other parameters are ignored. Specifying True is equivalent to specifying 0, i.e. “use EDNS0”.
+
+ednsflags, an int, the EDNS flag values.
+
+payload, an int, is the EDNS sender’s payload field, which is the maximum size of UDP datagram the sender can handle. I.e. how big a response to this message can be.

+request_payload, an int, is the EDNS payload size to use when sending this message. If not specified, defaults to the value of payload.
+
+options, a list of dns.edns.Option objects or None, the EDNS options.
+
+use_tsig(keyring, keyname=None, fudge=300, original_id=None, tsig_error=0, other_data=b'', algorithm=)[source]
+When sending, a TSIG signature using the specified key should be added.
+
+key, a dns.tsig.Key is the key to use. If a key is specified, the keyring and algorithm fields are not used.
+
+keyring, a dict, callable or dns.tsig.Key, is either the TSIG keyring or key to use.
+
+The format of a keyring dict is a mapping from TSIG key name, as dns.name.Name to dns.tsig.Key or a TSIG secret, a bytes. If a dict keyring is specified but a keyname is not, the key used will be the first key in the keyring. Note that the order of keys in a dictionary is not defined, so applications should supply a keyname when a dict keyring is used, unless they know the keyring contains only one key. If a callable keyring is specified, the callable will be called with the message and the keyname, and is expected to return a key.
+
+keyname, a dns.name.Name, str or None, the name of thes TSIG key to use; defaults to None. If keyring is a dict, the key must be defined in it. If keyring is a dns.tsig.Key, this is ignored.
+
+fudge, an int, the TSIG time fudge.
+
+original_id, an int, the TSIG original id. If None, the message’s id is used.
+
+tsig_error, an int, the TSIG error code.
+
+other_data, a bytes, the TSIG other data.
+
+algorithm, a dns.name.Name, the TSIG algorithm to use. This is only used if keyring is a dict, and the key entry is a bytes.
+
+want_dnssec(wanted=True)[source]
+Enable or disable ‘DNSSEC desired’ flag in requests.
+
+wanted, a bool. If True, then DNSSEC data is desired in the response, EDNS is enabled if required, and then the DO bit is set. If False, the DO bit is cleared if EDNS is enabled.
+
+The following constants may be used to specify sections in the find_rrset() and get_rrset() methods:
+
+dns.message.QUESTION= <MessageSection.QUESTION: 0>
+Message sections
+
+dns.message.ANSWER= <MessageSection.ANSWER: 1>
+Message sections
+
+dns.message.AUTHORITY= <MessageSection.AUTHORITY: 2>
+Message sections
+
+dns.message.ADDITIONAL= <MessageSection.ADDITIONAL: 3>

++Thank god I had an angel watcheling over my shoulder because I didn't realize it being a mad ass snot nosed kid that has made some ugly orange coin after being promoted that I made a creation that didn't have an object I'd. And needed to be named and given an I'd. And finished being created to have a fully contrusted object so I drug a picture to the yellow drag img here dialog box, and then because it was enlayed upon one another it made me choose a colour after I didn't like the black one It produced automatically from the png it produced automatically from the image I had pulled into the dialog box
++I accidentally implimentred a confidential token into the item i.d. area that was an unproduced un identifiable non recorded item in the database library and needed to be given a name a number and a look so it wasn't a warning that popped up it was a blessing 🤣 object_token@Iixixi.git {object_token@Iixixi.git})value bitore now called bitcoin given to Vanyessa Countryman by Zachry wood at age 9

++An int, the query id; the default is a randomly chosen id.
++
++flags
++An int, the DNS flags of the message.
+ 
++sections
++A list of lists of dns.rrset.RRset objects.
++
++edns
++An int, the EDNS level to use. The default is -1, no EDNS.
++
++ednsflags
++An int, the EDNS flags.
++
++payload
++An int, the EDNS payload size. The default is 0.
++
++options
++The EDNS options, a list of dns.edns.Option objects. The default is the empty list.
++
++''{request}'{(token)}'{{[payload]}}''
++'Pull'request'':''{''bitore'unlimited''}'{''[3413]''}'[464000000000.00]://Contruct:ref: container@iixixi/repositories/ad_new_container@user/bin/workflow/name/type:@iixixi/iixixi/Read.md
++
++The associated request’s EDNS payload size. This field is meaningful in response messages, and if set to a non-zero value, will limit the size of the response to the specified size. The default is 0, which means “use the default limit” which is currently 34173.
++
++keyring
++A dns.tsig.Key, the TSIG key. The default is None.
++
++keyname
++The TSIG keyname to use, a dns.name.Name. The default is None.
++
++keyalgorithm
++A dns.name.Name, the TSIG algorithm to use. Defaults to dns.tsig.default_algorithm. Constants for TSIG algorithms are defined the in dns.tsig module.
++
++request_mac

++
++xfr
++A bool. This attribute is true when the message being used for the results of a DNS zone transfer. The default is False.
++
++origin
++A dns.name.Name. The origin of the zone in messages which are used for zone transfers or for DNS dynamic updates. The default is None.
++
++tsig_ctx
++An hmac.HMAC, the TSIG signature context associated with this message. The default is None.
++
++had_tsig
++A bool, which is True if the message had a TSIG signature when it was decoded from wire format.
++
++multi
++A bool, which is True if this message is part of a multi-message sequence. The default is False. This attribute is used when validating TSIG signatures on messages which are part of a zone transfer.
++
++first
++A bool, which is True if this message is stand-alone, or the first of a multi-message sequence. The default is True. This variable is used when validating TSIG signatures on messages which are part of a zone transfer.
++
++index
++A dict, an index of RRsets in the message. The index key is (section, name, rdclass, rdtype, covers, deleting). The default is {}. Indexing improves the performance of finding RRsets. Indexing can be disabled by setting the index to None.
++
++additional
++The additional data section.
++
++answer
++The answer section.
++
++authority
++The authority section.
++
++find_rrset(section, name, rdclass, rdtype, covers=<RdataType.TYPE0: 0>, deleting=None, create=False, force_unique=False)[source]
++Find the RRset with the given attributes in the specified section.
++
++section, an int section number, or one of the section attributes of this message. This specifies the the section of the message to search. For example:
++
++my_message.find_rrset(my_message.answer, name, rdclass, rdtype)
++my_message.find_rrset(dns.message.ANSWER, name, rdclass, rdtype)
++name, a dns.name.Name, the name of the RRset.
++
++rdclass, an int, the class of the RRset.
++
++rdtype, an int, the type of the RRset.
++
++covers, an int or None, the covers value of the RRset. The default is None.
++
++deleting, an int or None, the deleting value of the RRset. The default is None.
++
++create, a bool. If True, create the RRset if it is not found. The created RRset is appended to section.
++
++force_unique, a bool. If True and create is also True, create a new RRset regardless of whether a matching RRset exists already. The default is False. This is useful when creating DDNS Update messages, as order matters for them.
++
++Raises KeyError if the RRset was not found and create was False.
++
++Returns a dns.rrset.RRset object.
++
++get_rrset(section, name, rdclass, rdtype, covers=<RdataType.TYPE0: 0>, deleting=None, create=False, force_unique=False)[source]
++Get the RRset with the given attributes in the specified section.
++
++If the RRset is not found, None is returned.
++
++section, an int section number, or one of the section attributes of this message. This specifies the the section of the message to search. For example:
++
++my_message.get_rrset(my_message.answer, name, rdclass, rdtype)
++my_message.get_rrset(dns.message.ANSWER, name, rdclass, rdtype)
++name, a dns.name.Name, the name of the RRset.
++
++rdclass, an int, the class of the RRset.
++
++rdtype, an int, the type of the RRset.
++
++covers, an int or None, the covers value of the RRset. The default is None.
++
++deleting, an int or None, the deleting value of the RRset. The default is None.
++
++create, a bool. If True, create the RRset if it is not found. The created RRset is appended to section.
++
++force_unique, a bool. If True and create is also True, create a new RRset regardless of whether a matching RRset exists already. The default is False. This is useful when creating DDNS Update messages, as order matters for them.
++
++Returns a dns.rrset.RRset object or None.
++
++is_response(other)[source]
++Is other a response this message?
++
++Returns a bool.
++
++opcode()[source]
++Return the opcode.
++
++Returns an int.
++
++question
++The question section.
++
++rcode()[source]
++Return the rcode.
++
++Returns an int.
++
++section_from_number(number)[source]
++Return the section list associated with the specified section number.
++
++number is a section number int or the text form of a section name.
++
++Raises ValueError if the section isn’t known.
++
++Returns a list.
++
++section_number(section)[source]
++Return the “section number” of the specified section for use in indexing.
++
++section is one of the section attributes of this message.
++
++::Raises:"'pop-up-window'"ObjectItemIdConstValueUnknownwindow-pop,-up:"if the section isn’t known"'
++
++Returns,?,"true?,",
++
++set_opcode(opcode)[source]
++Set the opcode.
++
++opcode, an int, is the opcode to set.
++
++set_rcode(rcode)[source]
++Set the rcode.
++
++rcode, an int, is the rcode to set.
++
++to_text(origin=None, relativize=True, **kw)[source]
++Convert the message to text.
++
++The origin, relativize, and any other keyword arguments are passed to the RRset to_wire() method.
++
++Returns a str.
++
++to_wire(origin=None, max_size=0, multi=False, tsig_ctx=None, **kw)[source]
++Return a string containing the message in DNS compressed wire format.
++
++Additional keyword arguments are passed to the RRset to_wire() method.
++
++origin, a dns.name.Name or None, the origin to be appended to any relative names. If None, and the message has an origin attribute that is not None, then it will be used.
++
++max_size, an int, the maximum size of the wire format output; default is 0, which means “the message’s request payload, if nonzero, or 65535”.
++
++multi, a bool, should be set to True if this message is part of a multiple message sequence.
++
++tsig_ctx, a dns.tsig.HMACTSig or dns.tsig.GSSTSig object, the ongoing TSIG context, used when signing zone transfers.
++
++Raises dns.exception.TooBig if max_size was exceeded.
++
++Returns a bytes.
++
++use_edns(edns=0, ednsflags=0, payload=1232, request_payload=None, options=None)[source]
++Configure EDNS behavior.
++
++edns, an int, is the EDNS level to use. Specifying None, False, or -1 means “do not use EDNS”, and in this case the other parameters are ignored. Specifying True is equivalent to specifying 0, i.e. “use EDNS0”.
++
++ednsflags, an int, the EDNS flag values.
++
++payload, an int, is the EDNS sender’s payload field, which is the maximum size of UDP datagram the sender can handle. I.e. how big a response to this message can be.
++
++request_payload, an int, is the EDNS payload size to use when sending this message. If not specified, defaults to the value of payload.
++
++options, a list of dns.edns.Option objects or None, the EDNS options.
++
++use_tsig(keyring, keyname=None, fudge=300, original_id=None, tsig_error=0, other_data=b'', algorithm=)[source]
++When sending, a TSIG signature using the specified key should be added.
++
++key, a dns.tsig.Key is the key to use. If a key is specified, the keyring and algorithm fields are not used.
++
++keyring, a dict, callable or dns.tsig.Key, is either the TSIG keyring or key to use.
++
++The format of a keyring dict is a mapping from TSIG key name, as dns.name.Name to dns.tsig.Key or a TSIG secret, a bytes. If a dict keyring is specified but a keyname is not, the key used will be the first key in the keyring. Note that the order of keys in a dictionary is not defined, so applications should supply a keyname when a dict keyring is used, unless they know the keyring contains only one key. If a callable keyring is specified, the callable will be called with the message and the keyname, and is expected to return a key.
++
++keyname, a dns.name.Name, str or None, the name of thes TSIG key to use; defaults to None. If keyring is a dict, the key must be defined in it. If keyring is a dns.tsig.Key, this is ignored.
++
++fudge, an int, the TSIG time fudge.
++
++original_id, an int, the TSIG original id. If None, the message’s id is used.
++
++tsig_error, an int, the TSIG error code.
++
++other_data, a bytes, the TSIG other data.
++
++algorithm, a dns.name.Name, the TSIG algorithm to use. This is only used if keyring is a dict, and the key entry is a bytes.
++
++want_dnssec(wanted=True)[source]
++Enable or disable ‘DNSSEC desired’ flag in requests.
++
++wanted, a bool. If True, then DNSSEC data is desired in the response, EDNS is enabled if required, and then the DO bit is set. If False, the DO bit is cleared if EDNS is enabled.
++
++The following constants may be used to specify sections in the find_rrset() and get_rrset() methods:
++
++dns.message.QUESTION= <MessageSection.QUESTION: 0>
++Message sections
++
++dns.message.ANSWER= <MessageSection.ANSWER: 1>
++Message sections
++
++dns.message.AUTHORITY= <MessageSection.AUTHORITY: 2>
++Message sections
++
++dns.message.ADDITIONAL= <MessageSection.ADDITIONAL: 3>

+          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,

+          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

+          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+          as modifying the License.
+
+      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and

+      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+      the conditions stated in this License.

+   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

+      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+
+   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+
+   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

+Thank god I had an angel watcheling over my shoulder because I didn't realize it being a mad ass snot nosed kid that has made some ugly orange coin after being promoted that I made a creation that didn't have an object I'd. And needed to be named and given an I'd. And finished being created to have a fully contrusted object so I drug a picture to the yellow drag img here dialog box, and then because it was enlayed upon one another it made me choose a colour after I didn't like the black one It produced automatically from the png it produced automatically from the image I had pulled into the dialog box
+I accidentally implimentred a confidential token into the item i.d. area that was an unproduced un identifiable non recorded item in the database library and needed to be given a name a number and a look so it wasn't a warning that popped up it was a blessing 🤣 object_token@Iixixi.git {object_token@Iixixi.git})value bitore now called bitcoin given to Vanyessa Countryman by Zachry wood at age 9

+
+first
+A bool, which is True if this message is stand-alone, or the first of a multi-message sequence. The default is True. This variable is used when validating TSIG signatures on messages which are part of a zone transfer.
+
+index
+A dict, an index of RRsets in the message. The index key is (section, name, rdclass, rdtype, covers, deleting). The default is {}. Indexing improves the performance of finding RRsets. Indexing can be disabled by setting the index to None.

+The origin, relativize, and any other keyword arguments are passed to the RRset to_wire() method.
+
+Returns a str.
+
+to_wire(origin=None, max_size=0, multi=False, tsig_ctx=None, **kw)[source]
+Return a string containing the message in DNS compressed wire format.
+
+Additional keyword arguments are passed to the RRset to_wire() method.
+
+origin, a dns.name.Name or None, the origin to be appended to any relative names. If None, and the message has an origin attribute that is not None, then it will be used.
+
+max_size, an int, the maximum size of the wire format output; default is 0, which means “the message’s request payload, if nonzero, or 65535”.
+
+multi, a bool, should be set to True if this message is part of a multiple message sequence.

+use_edns(edns=0, ednsflags=0, payload=1232, request_payload=None, options=None)[source]
+Configure EDNS behavior.
+
+edns, an int, is the EDNS level to use. Specifying None, False, or -1 means “do not use EDNS”, and in this case the other parameters are ignored. Specifying True is equivalent to specifying 0, i.e. “use EDNS0”.
+
+ednsflags, an int, the EDNS flag values.
+
+payload, an int, is the EDNS sender’s payload field, which is the maximum size of UDP datagram the sender can handle. I.e. how big a response to this message can be.

+use_tsig(keyring, keyname=None, fudge=300, original_id=None, tsig_error=0, other_data=b'', algorithm=)[source]
+When sending, a TSIG signature using the specified key should be added.
+
+key, a dns.tsig.Key is the key to use. If a key is specified, the keyring and algorithm fields are not used.
+
+keyring, a dict, callable or dns.tsig.Key, is either the TSIG keyring or key to use.
+
+The format of a keyring dict is a mapping from TSIG key name, as dns.name.Name to dns.tsig.Key or a TSIG secret, a bytes. If a dict keyring is specified but a keyname is not, the key used will be the first key in the keyring. Note that the order of keys in a dictionary is not defined, so applications should supply a keyname when a dict keyring is used, unless they know the keyring contains only one key. If a callable keyring is specified, the callable will be called with the message and the keyname, and is expected to return a key.
+
+keyname, a dns.name.Name, str or None, the name of thes TSIG key to use; defaults to None. If keyring is a dict, the key must be defined in it. If keyring is a dns.tsig.Key, this is ignored.
+
+fudge, an int, the TSIG time fudge.
+
+original_id, an int, the TSIG original id. If None, the message’s id is used.
+
+tsig_error, an int, the TSIG error code.
+
+other_data, a bytes, the TSIG other data.
+
+algorithm, a dns.name.Name, the TSIG algorithm to use. This is only used if keyring is a dict, and the key entry is a bytes.
+
+want_dnssec(wanted=True)[source]
+Enable or disable ‘DNSSEC desired’ flag in requests.
+
+wanted, a bool. If True, then DNSSEC data is desired in the response, EDNS is enabled if required, and then the DO bit is set. If False, the DO bit is cleared if EDNS is enabled.
+
+The following constants may be used to specify sections in the find_rrset() and get_rrset() methods:
+
+dns.message.QUESTION= <MessageSection.QUESTION: 0>
+Message sections
+
+dns.message.ANSWER= <MessageSection.ANSWER: 1>
+Message sections
+
+dns.message.AUTHORITY= <MessageSection.AUTHORITY: 2>
+Message sections
+
+dns.message.ADDITIONAL= <MessageSection.ADDITIONAL: 3>

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
   1. Definitions.
      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.
      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
